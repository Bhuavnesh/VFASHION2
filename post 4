<p>Mergers and acquisitions&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/a-running-timeline-of-fashion-and-luxury-mergers-acquisitions/">continue to garner headlines&nbsp;</a>amid enduring consolidation in the fashion, luxury, sportswear, and beauty segments, as well as in the resale and web3 realms. Key deals have seen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/a-running-timeline-of-the-16-2-billion-tiffany-co-v-lvmh-battle/">LVMH add Tiffany &amp; Co. to its lineup</a>&nbsp;of brands, bolstering its position in the hard luxury space;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/nike-acquires-digital-fashion-sneaker-co-rtfkt-in-latest-metaverse-move/">Nike purchase</a>&nbsp;digitally-native brand RTFKT, as companies place their bets on the burgeoning virtual world; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/richemont-and-farfetch-breaking-down-the-ynap-deal/">Farfetch nab a 47.5 percent stake</a>&nbsp;in Yoox Net-a-Porter in what is expected to the first leg of a larger transaction. At the same time, other acquisitions are proving to be integral to the operations of fashion and luxury industry entities – those that see big brands amass stakes in their critical suppliers (or acquire those companies outright) in an effort to exert increased control over the manufacturing of their offerings and shore up their supply chains to ensure closer ties to sources of raw materials and valuable know-how.&nbsp;</p>

Nonetheless, vertical integration activities appear to have been accelerated by the impact of COVID-19, which has required companies to “shift to e-commerce sales channel and [engage in] supply chain reorganization and monitoring,” things that&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/it/Documents/finance/Fashion-Luxury-2022_Deloitte.pdf">Deloitte points to</a>&nbsp;as among the “main new strategies adopted by companies” in the wake of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

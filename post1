<p>Danielle Meijerink started with a 4-year degree in fashion and tailoring and another study at Jean School. She graduated in 2019 and moved to Spain to start her career as a designer where she takes care of the denim and woven designs. Niels Mulder, a 2015 Jean School graduate, moved to Basel 7 years ago to work for EDWIN Europe GmbH, where he works as a Denim Designer/Developer.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jean School also attracts a good variety of students internationally, including Angelo Sebastian Page. He first studied fashion design in Cape Town, specializing in womenswear.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some students start their own brand or platform. Tim Sluijzer, a 2017 graduate, founded a community brand called AICHE 3 years ago with his partner. A platform where they aim to bring creatives together and create cool things like clothing, furniture and pop-up stores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's not only after Jean School, but also during the courses that students are given great opportunities. Soufyan Benrhziyel, a 2015 Jean School graduate and currently Senior Denim Designer says,&nbsp;<em>"My graduation collection was named The Revival Of The Mob. An ode to my upbringing where I watched the Godfather Trilogy with my father. I designed a cutting-edge collection made from hemp sourced from an Italian denim mill. This achievement took me to Levi's in San Francisco, an experience to remember. Organized by Jean School: an academy that made me believe in my skills."</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mira Copini</strong>, Head of Jean School &amp; Fashion for RoC Amsterdam says,&nbsp;<em>“since 2012, over 300 students have started the course and we are extremely proud of all our alumni who really make a new kind of blueprint for the industry. Jean School is the first school in the world actually training students for the sustainable side of the industry and at the same time giving them the freedom to design and develop their own vision about the future of denim.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mariette Hoitink</strong>, co-founder of the House of Denim Foundation &amp; Jean School, says,&nbsp;<em>”Who could have imagined that our article in the NewYork Times, when we did the pilot, sustained into a real school. This type of education is also so unique because it is based in the denim innovation hub Denim City Amsterdam which houses a workshop/atelier, a laundry lab, showrooms, classrooms, an archive and a store. Getting educated and at the same time experiencing real life around you working ‘Towards a Brighter Blue’. It’s all about creating beauty and kicking asses.”</em></p>
